Definitely try to tell the upstream and make a patch if you're capable

OK, you fixed a bug, but it may be a while until that release - what should you do? 

YOu can do a workaround as long as you document so you can change it later. Of course, only works if you only hit the bug in one place.

You can make a wrapper function so that things work the way they're supposed to and has the right API.

try not to do vendoring - it's leaky and hard to maintain
