How Bloomberg started using Python

At Bloomberg they had a lot of despoke network protocols and closed database APIs

An intern created wrappers for those libraries...

Bloomberg created a Python guild to manage python stuff at the company

Some of their problems:
    - versions of Python were managed ad-hoc
    - one-ff variables of the C++ wrappers
    - built on C++ infrastructure
    
THe C++ wrappers meant folks were writing Python like C++


To get things under control, they had the devs work with the Guild instead of starting their own stuff

InnerSource model - like open source, but for the company. Anyone in the company can do issues and PRs
