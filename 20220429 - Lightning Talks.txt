Covariance, Contravariance, Invariance
    - Covariance - you can replace a class with another. If Cat is a descendant of Animal, it's covariant
    - Contravariance - you can replace a cat class with an Animal class
    - Invariance - you cannot replace one of class with its descendants

The future of trust stores in Python
    - trust store is a collection of certs (like SSL)
    - trust store gives you one set of certs instead of per application

What is Synthetic Data?
    - alternative to real world data
    - solves problem of not being able to get access to usable testing data - because otherwise you might need to have access to CC#s
    - sometimes only limited data is available
    - data could be biased - intentionally or unintentionally
    - Synthetic data is meant to fix this - the synthetic data generator looks at your real data and figures out the patterns and then creates fake data that can be used and shared
    - Or it could extrapolate your data out to get more data
    - can reduce bias 
    - better than fake or mock data because it's based on the real data

Elegant Code in 3 Steps
    - Requires refactoring
    - Flocking Rules
        - Identify things that are most alike
        - Find the smallest difference between them
        - Make simple changes that will remove the differences in 4 phases:
            - parse new code
            - parse and execute it
            - parse, execute, and use its result
            - delete unused code
            (this will make more sense if you watch the talk

Getting to 100% Coverage and Why it Matters
    - You can get really close, but it's hard to actually get to 100%
    - what's in the last 2$? 
        - Nontrivial unreachable code
        - hard to test code
    - Hard to tell if you're growing or reducing coverage if you're not at 100%
    - only skip immaterial lines
    - can help to put a comment on lines withotu coverage - like #COV_MISSING
