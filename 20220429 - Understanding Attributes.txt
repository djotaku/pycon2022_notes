"variables" in classes are attributes, not variables

every object in Python has attributes

Attributes can contain any Python object - both data and objects

__init__ is NOT the constructor object. It's job is to add attributes to your object

really should never use global on a variable

the entire body of the class executed - just not the functions. 

Classes should be considered file-less modules

So functions in teh class are essentially attributes.

How Python looks for attributes:
    - Iinstance
    - Class
    - class' Parent
    - Object
    ICPO
